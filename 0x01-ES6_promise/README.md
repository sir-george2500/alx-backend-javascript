# ES6 Promises

**Introduction to ES6 Promises**
==============================

ES6 Promises are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows you to handle **asynchronous operations** in a more efficient and organized way. A Promise represents a result that may not be available yet, but will be **resolved** at some point in the future.

**Key Features**
---------------

* **Asynchronous**: Promises handle **asynchronous operations**, allowing your code to continue running without blocking.
* **Resolve**: A Promise **resolves** when the operation is complete, returning a value or an error.
* **Chaining**: Promises can be **chained together**, allowing you to handle multiple **asynchronous operations** in a sequence.
* **Error Handling**: Promises provide a built-in **error handling mechanism**, allowing you to catch and handle errors in a centralized way.

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	// Asynchronous operation here
	resolve(value); // or reject(error)
});

promise.then((value) => {
	// Handle the resolved value
}).catch((error) => {
	// Handle the error
});

```
